# Project Overview
ArtGalleryWebsite provides a seamless experience for browsing and managing art collections. Deployed on an Ubuntu server with Nginx as a reverse proxy, it uses pre-published application files from the GitHub repository for quick setup.

Repository: github.com/Sadiq-code-nest/Art-Gallery
Live Deployment: http://54.161.71.139 (Master branch)

# Quick Deployment
Deploy ArtGalleryWebsite on an Ubuntu server with automated scripts for both development and production environments. Follow the steps below to get started.
prerequisites

Ubuntu Server: Version 20.04 or 22.04 with SSH access.
SSH Key: Located at C:\Users\User\Downloads\Others\key-ssh.pem on your local machine.
GitHub Repository: Ensure the publish folder in github.com/Sadiq-code-nest/Art-Gallery contains pre-published ASP.NET Core files.
Port Configuration: Set port 5000 in Properties/launchSettings.json and comment out app.UseHttpsRedirection() in Program.cs.
Internet Access: Required for downloading dependencies and cloning the repository.

development server
Run these commands on your Ubuntu server to deploy in a development environment:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sadiq-code-nest/Art-Gallery/main/deploy_aspnetcore.sh
chmod +x deploy_aspnetcore.sh
./deploy_aspnetcore.sh

This script:

Installs Nginx and .NET Core (SDK and runtime).
Clones the publish folder from the GitHub repository.
Configures Nginx as a reverse proxy and sets up a systemd service.

production server
Use the same script for production, as it includes production settings (ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production) and automatic service restarts:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sadiq-code-nest/Art-Gallery/main/deploy_aspnetcore.sh
chmod +x deploy_aspnetcore.sh
./deploy_aspnetcore.sh

one-step setup
For a fully automated deployment, use this script to download and run the deployment script:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sadiq-code-nest/Art-Gallery/main/setup_and_deploy.sh
chmod +x setup_and_deploy.sh
./setup_and_deploy.sh

Local Development
Set up and run ArtGalleryWebsite locally for development or testing.
